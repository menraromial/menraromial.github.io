## Master Linux Scheduling from A to Z!

This **comprehensive guide** takes you on an in-depth journey into the heart of Linux scheduling. From fundamental concepts to the intricacies of real-time systems with `PREEMPT_RT` and the challenges of scheduling in distributed environments, this course is designed for system developers, advanced Linux administrators, and DevOps engineers cottura to master the performance and responsiveness of their systems.

**What You Will Learn:**

*   **The Fundamentals:** Understand the crucial role of scheduling, classic algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR), and evaluation criteria.
*   **The Linux Kernel Scheduler:** Dive into the architecture of Linux scheduling classes, master the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**, and understand `SCHED_NORMAL`, `SCHED_BATCH`, and `SCHED_IDLE` policies.
*   **Real-Time Scheduling:** Master `SCHED_FIFO`, `SCHED_RR`, and the powerful `SCHED_DEADLINE` policies. Understand sources of latency and how the **`PREEMPT_RT`** patch transforms Linux for critical applications.
*   **Distributed Systems:** Explore scheduling challenges beyond a single node, including load balancing, task migration, and solutions used in HPC clusters (Slurm) and Cloud/Container platforms (Kubernetes).
*   **Tooling and Monitoring:** Effectively use `top`, `ps`, `perf`, `ftrace`, eBPF, and `/proc` interfaces to analyze and diagnose scheduler behavior.
*   **Optimization and `cgroups`:** Learn to optimize performance through CPU affinity, kernel parameters, and manage CPU resources with Control Groups (`cgroups`).
*   **Best Practices and Case Studies:** Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios (web servers, RT applications, HPC, multimedia) and adopt best practices.
*   **Future Outlook:** Discover emerging trends like scheduling for heterogeneous architectures (EAS) and the potential role of AI.
*   **Practical Exercises:** Each relevant chapter includes hands-on labs to solidify your learning.

**Who Is This Course For?**

*   Kernel or system developers muá»‘n to understand and optimize scheduling.
*   Linux system administrators seeking to improve server performance and stability.
*   DevOps engineers involved in resource management for containerized or cloud applications.
*   Computer science students (Master's, Engineering) specializing in operating systems.
*   Anyone curious to deeply understand how Linux manages task execution.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Basic knowledge of operating systems (processes, threads).
*   Basic Linux command-line usage.
*   Notions of C programming (recommended for some examples and labs).

Get ready to master one of the most critical and fascinating aspects of Linux! This course is your roadmap to confidently navigating the world of advanced scheduling.

**Course Outline (Main Chapters):**

*   Chapter 0: General Introduction
*   Chapter 1: Introduction and Fundamental Refresher
*   Chapter 2: Classic Schedulers (Theory)
*   Chapter 3: Scheduling in the Linux Kernel
