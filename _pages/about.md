Driven by a deep interest in the **future of IoT ecosystems**, I will focus my efforts on developing **scalable and sustainable solutions** for software deployment across the *Cloud-to-Edge-IoT continuum*. My research will explore **decentralized approaches** to device management, enabling the efficient deployment and updates of system images and containerized applications for a wide range of devices, from resource-intensive gateways to highly constrained edge equipment. 

I aim to leverage **cutting-edge experimentation platforms** to facilitate large-scale, reproducible deployments while addressing crucial challenges in **energy efficiency** and **sustainability**. 

By combining advanced *cloud-native technologies* with innovative *distributed system designs*, I will contribute to shaping the **next generation of IoT solutions**.
